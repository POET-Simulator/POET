* Chemical system

The benchmark depicts a porous system where pure water is initially at
equilibrium with *celestite* (strontium sulfate; brute formula:
SrSO_4).

A solution containing only dissolved Ba^{2+} and Cl^- diffuses into
the system causing celestite dissolution. The increased concentration
of dissolved sulfate SO_{4}^{2-} induces precipitation of *barite*
(barium sulfate; brute formula: BaSO_{4}^{2-}). The overall reaction
can be written:

Ba^{2+} + celestite \rightarrow barite + Sr^{2+}

Both celestite dissolution and barite precipitation are calculated
using a kinetics rate law based on transition state theory:

rate = -S_{m} K (1-SR_{m})

where the reaction rate has units mol/s, S_{m} (m^{2}) is the reactive
surface area, K (mol/m^{2}/s) is the rate constant, and SR is the
saturation ratio, i.e., the ratio of the ion activity product of the
reacting species and the solubility constant.

For barite, the reaction rate is computed as sum of two mechanisms,
/acid/ and /neutral/:

    rate_{barite}  = S_{m} (acid + neutral) * (1 - SR_{barite})

where

    acid = 10^{-6.9} \exp(\frac {-30800 \cdot T'} R) * act(H^{+})^{0.22}

and

    neutral = 10^{-7.9} \exp( \frac {-30800 * T'} R)

R is the gas constant (8.314462 J / K / mol) and T' (K^{-1}) accounts
for temperature dependence of the kinetic coefficients which are
experimentally determined at 25 Â°C or 298.15 K

    T' = (1 / K) - (1 / 298.15)
       

The kinetic rate law as implemented in the =db_barite.dat= file
accepts one parameter which represents reactive surface area in m^{2}.
For this benchmarks the surface areas are set to

- S_{barite}: 50 m^{2}
- S_{celestite}: 10 m^{2}
